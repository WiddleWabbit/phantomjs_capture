The module comes with an integration to PhantomJS which allows you to take
screenshots of URLs as images or PDF and use them on your site.

The module comes with an administration interface to allows you to configure the
location of PhantomJS and a default destination folder. It also has a test
function to test if your configuration works. PhantomJS works by giving
phantom an JavaScript file that tells phantom what to do and this module comes
with a default JavaScript file that renders full HD size screenshots.

For more information about PhantomJS possibilities you should look at the wiki
pages at https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki and the examples that come
with PhantomJS.
